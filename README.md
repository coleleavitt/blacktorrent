- [ ] Guard all initialization with stack/heap assertions as per JPL RLOC-4.

---

## New/Recommended Files

- **utp/fuzz.rs**  
  For property-based/fuzz testing of packet parsing, state transitions, etc.

- **utp/extensions.rs**  
  For optional protocol extension parsing/negotiation beyond SACK.

- **utp/no_std_panic.rs**  
  Custom panic handler for radiation-hardened `no_std` targets.

- **utp/verification.rs**  
  Proof artifacts, KLEE/Coq/SEER harnesses, and static analysis stubs.

- **utp/logger.rs**  
  Flight/safety-compliant logging and diagnostics.

---

## Testing & Verification (all modules)
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests (tokio/async-std, dispatcher/client/server).
- [ ] Add interop tests with a reference implementation (libutp, at least basic connect/send/close).
- [ ] Property-based/fuzz test: packet.rs, reliability.rs, connection.rs.
- [ ] Static analysis: all code (`-Z emit-stack-sizes`), generate/verify stack usage report.
- [ ] Add (or document) KLEE/SEER model checking state machine for critical path.
