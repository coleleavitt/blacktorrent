Certainly! Here is a **comprehensive, detailed checklist** tailored to your implementation, addressing both core protocol requirements and JPL's safety-critical, radiation-hardened standards. This will help you bring your uTP stack to production and verification readiness:

---

# uTP Full Implementation & Mission-Critical Compliance Checklist

## 1. Core Protocol: Connection Lifecycle

- [x] **SYN handshake**
- [x] **State transitions (Uninitialized, Idle, SynSent, SynRecv, Connected, FinSent, FinRecv, Reset, Closed, Destroying)**
- [x] **Sequence number management (wrapping, validation)**
- [x] **FIN packet generation and tracking**

- [ ] **Graceful teardown:**
   - [ ] Four-way FIN handshake (each direction may close independently)
   - [ ] Simultaneous close/open (handle race conditions)
   - [ ] Draining/retransmission of final segments
   - [ ] Timeout handling for teardown

- [ ] **Abort/reset:**
   - [ ] Proper handling of RESET packets in all states
   - [ ] Resource cleanup/notification

---

## 2. Reliability & Ordering

- [x] **Retransmission timeout (RTO) and backoff**
- [x] **RTT & RTO estimation (SRTT, RTTVAR, RTO bounds)**
- [x] **Selective ACKs (basic SACK extension)**

- [ ] **Comprehensive reliability:**
   - [ ] Retransmit on all loss triggers (timeout, triple duplicate ACKs, SACK holes)
   - [ ] Full SACK: handle out-of-order delivery, arbitrary gaps, and partial retransmissions
   - [ ] Maximum retransmissions: conclusive error/teardown after repeated loss

---

## 3. Congestion Control

- [x] **LEDBAT-inspired (delay-based) congestion window**
- [x] **Window management, slow start, and triple modular redundancy (TMR)**

- [ ] **ADVANCED features:**
   - [ ] Window scaling (high-BDP support)
   - [ ] Accurate target delay and minimal base delay reset per LEDBAT spec
   - [ ] Explicit Nagle suppression (delay small packets)

---

## 4. Async/Integration Layer

- [x] **Dispatcher for async I/O on UDP socket**
- [x] **Per-connection state isolation**
- [x] **Triple-redundant notification/event system (TMR)**

- [ ] **Async runtime compliance:**
   - [ ] Proper integration with tokio/async-std (waker, readiness, shutdown propagation)
   - [ ] Full `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` support on streams with backpressure, zero-copy options
   - [ ] Event-driven tick system (timers, not polling)
   - [ ] Efficient management of pending/active connections
   - [ ] Support for high-throughput, low-latency batch packet send/recv

---

## 5. Error Handling & Recovery

- [x] **Basic error types (Timeout, Reset, Network, Internal)**
- [ ] **Comprehensive coverage:**
   - [ ] All state transitions validate context/arguments
   - [ ] All send/recv/checkpoint operations check for resource exhaustion, encoding/decoding errors
   - [ ] All error types are propagated to user and dispatcher with JPL-compliant error codes and structured error reporting

---

## 6. Security, Safety, Fault Tolerance

- [x] **No `unsafe` code (except FFI or verified atomic ops)**
- [x] **Triple modular redundancy (TMR) for critical counters/IDs**
- [x] **Fault isolation in dispatcher and socket manager**
- [x] **Timeouts on all async operations**

- [ ] **Hardening:**
   - [ ] End-to-end integrity checks on all critical data (IDs, sequence numbers, control info)
   - [ ] Radiation-hardened panic handler in `no_std`
   - [ ] Stack and heap usage bounds (static, using `-Z emit-stack-sizes`)
   - [ ] Memory arena allocator certification
   - [ ] Volatile MMIO support if targeting HW
   - [ ] Defensive zeroization of cryptographic and sensitive state

---

## 7. Protocol Extensions

- [x] **SACK extension**
- [ ] **Future extensions:**
   - [ ] Dynamic extension negotiation per BEP-29 (e.g., DHT_PORT, custom extensions)
   - [ ] Optionally: congestion signaling, fast open, or custom mission-specific extensions

---

## 8. Comprehensive Testing

- [x] **Unit tests for all primitives (connection, reliability, congestion, dispatcher)**
- [ ] **Full functional/integration tests:**
   - [ ] End-to-end data transfer (connect/read/write/close)
   - [ ] Interop test: pass full test suite against a reference implementation (e.g., libutp)
   - [ ] Edge case tests (loss, reorder, duplication, partial window, teardown races)
   - [ ] Rate/throughput stress tests, burst traffic handling
   - [ ] Fuzz testing for packet parsing, state machine transitions, and input validation
- [ ] **Property-based testing and SEU (single event upset) injection**
- [ ] **KLEE or symbolic execution for navigation/critical algorithms**
- [ ] **Model checking (SEER, TLA+) for state machine liveness/safety**

---

## 9. Documentation & Certification

- [ ] **Detailed developer/user documentation for each module and API**
- [ ] **JPL coding standard compliance audit**
- [ ] **Static analysis report:**
   - [ ] Stack/heap bounds, all panics handled, no resource leaks
   - [ ] Memory safety and concurrency checks
- [ ] **Hardware-in-the-loop validation (FPGA, QEMU, etc.)**

---

## 10. Deployment, Monitoring, and Maintenance

- [ ] **Logging with mission/flight-rated verbosity controls**
- [ ] **Online health monitoring and diagnostics**
- [ ] **In-field fault recovery (dispatcher restart, redundancy failover)**
- [ ] **Automated update/deployment hooks**

---

## Legend

- [x] = Complete
- [ ] = TODO / Incomplete / Needs Review

## Next Steps

1. **Use this checklist to prioritize gaps (start with connection close, async runtime polish, and fuzz tests).**
2. **For each unchecked item, create actionable implementation or verification tasks.**
3. **If you need a template or reference implementation for any specific part, ask and I will provide JPL-compliant code/artifacts.**
