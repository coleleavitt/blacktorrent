    peer::connect_to_peer(example_peer_address);

    // 6. Main Loop: Manage Peer Connections, Request/Send Pieces
    // This would involve an event loop, handling network I/O (async programming is essential here),
    // piece selection strategies, choking/unchoking logic, etc.
    println!("Entering main event loop (placeholder)...");
    loop {
        // Placeholder for event handling (e.g., new peer, received piece, timer events)
        // In a real client, this would use async/await with a runtime like Tokio or async-std.

        // Example: Simulate requesting a piece
        // piece::request_piece("peer_id_example", 0);

        // Example: Simulate verifying a received piece
        // let dummy_piece_data = vec![0u8; 262144]; // 256KB dummy data
        // piece::verify_piece(0, &dummy_piece_data);

        // For demonstration, we'll just break after a short delay or a condition
        // std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(1));
        // In a real client, this loop runs until download completes or user quits.
        println!("Main loop iteration (placeholder - will exit for now)");
        break;
    }

    println!("BitTorrent client shutting down...");
}

// To build a full client, each module (utp, tracker, peer, piece, torrent_parser)
// must be thoroughly implemented with the actual protocol details.
// Asynchronous networking (e.g., using Tokio or async-std) is crucial for handling
// multiple peer connections and I/O operations efficiently.
// Error handling, robust parsing, and state management are also key aspects.
